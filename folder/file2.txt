A binary file is any type of file that is not a text file. Because of their nature, binary files can only be processed
by an application that know or understand the file’s structure. In other words, they must be applications that can read
and interpret binary.


Open ( ) Function

In order to open a file for writing or use in Python, you must rely on the built-in open () function.

As explained above, open ( ) will return a file object, so it is most commonly used with two arguments.

An argument is nothing more than a value that has been provided to a function, which is relayed when you call it. So,
for instance, if we declare the name of a file as “Test File,” that name would be considered an argument.
