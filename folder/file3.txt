Mode

Including a mode argument is optional because a default value of ‘r’ will be assumed if it is omitted.
The ‘r’ value stands for read mode, which is just one of many.

The modes are:

‘r’ – Read mode which is used when the file is only being read
‘w’ – Write mode which is used to edit and write new information to the file (any existing files with the same name
will be erased when this mode is activated)
‘a’ – Appending mode, which is used to add new data to the end of the file; that is new information is automatically
amended to the end
‘r+’ – Special read and write mode, which is used to handle both actions when working with a file
So, let’s take a look at a quick example.
